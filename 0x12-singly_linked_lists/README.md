Add node 2-add_node.c contains a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a list_t list.
Add node at the end 3-add_node_end.c contains a function that adds a new node at the end of a list_t list.
Free list 4-free_list.c contains a function that frees a list_t list.
The Hare and the Tortoise 100-first.c contains a function that prints You're beat! and yet, you must allow,\nI bore my house upon my back!\n before the main function is executed.
Real programmers can write assembly code in any language 101-hello_holberton.asm is a 64-bit program in assembly that prints Hello, Holberton, followed by a new line.
what are linked lists
A linked list is a data structure where one object refers to the next one in a sequence by storing its address. Each object is referred to as a node. In addition to a reference to the next object in the sequence, each object carries some data (e.g., integer value, reference to string, etc.). The following diagram illustrates a typical linked lists: image image
